I imagine a world,
where there's 
no black or white,
no one is hated,
no reason to fight.
I imagine a world,
where the good 
is promoted,
no evil agendas,
balanced truth is devoted.
Imagine a world,
full of color and light,
where a harmony of good,
and the black and white,
live truth as they should.
