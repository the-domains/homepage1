What-where, who-how, when and why, am I? 

Am I some idea, 

whose time has come, 

ever expanding and expressing, 

the mind I'm from? 

Communicating, 

in symbolic gestures, 

like words on a page 

that come to life. 

Actors on a stage, 

in fulfillment or contraction, 

make meaningful my reaction. 

Could I be, 

one with God? 

That part of me 

firmly planted on sod? 

Or if I ask who? 

Am I just another you? 

Can where and when,
be here and now? 

and is why then,
the truth I allow? 

Am I the warrior and romancer? 

Am I the question and the answer. 

Yes I Am.
